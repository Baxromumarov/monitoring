A beautiful, user-friendly monitoring dashboard for your Go applications. Instantly visualize function metrics (duration, memory, invocations) in real time, with zero dependencies beyond the Go standard library.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Real-time Dashboard**: See all monitored functions, their total/average duration, memory allocation, and invocation counts.
- **Detailed Function View**: Click any function to see per-call history (timestamp, duration, memory in MB).
- **Live Updating**: Dashboard auto-refreshes every second.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive Go template frontend.
- **Easy Integration**: Just import and wrap your functions.

    // ... your code ...
}
```

That's it! All calls will be tracked and visualized.
